# OS System Monitor Project

## Overview
Welcome to the System Monitor project repository! The System Resource Monitor project in Java utilizes the OSHI library to fetch and display key system resources such as CPU load, memory usage, disk I/O, and network bandwidth utilization. By interfacing directly with the system's hardware and operating system, it provides real-time insights into the performance and utilization of various system components.

## Project Proposal
System Resource Monitor : Identify current available and utilized resources of the system e.g., CPU, memory, I/O, and bandwidth. The program should be able to log historical system resources and capable to show resource utilization graph.

## Tech Use
- **Java**: A high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language.
- **Library OSHI**: A free JNA-based (native) Operating System and Hardware Information library for Java
- **Library JFreeChart**: JFreeChart is a comprehensive free chart library for the Javaâ„¢ platform that can be used on the client-side (JavaFX and Swing) or the server side
- **Git**: Version control system for collaboration and code management.
- **Code Editors and IDEs**: Visual Studio Code.
